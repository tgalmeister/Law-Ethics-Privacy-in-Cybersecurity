# Law-Ethics-Privacy in Cybersecurity

This is the name of one of my master's program classes that I took that explores legal, ethical, and privacy issues as they apply to cybersecurity. Includes the legalities and ethics of hacking, corporate information security and use policies, and the government's role in cybersecurity. Emphasizes the roles and responsibilities of individual cybersecurity practitioners as well as corporate entities, including vulnerability disclosure and correcting software defects. Teaches privacy policies and regulations as they relate to cybersecurity and information systems.

Attached in this repository is my final research apper I completed oin the class, Cyberlaw for Direct-To-Consumer Companies.
